== README

This is my first Ruby on Rails App. I am currently going through an online web development course offered through Career Foundry.

I'll add more to this when I know what I'm doing!

I also need to update the items below . . . when I know what they mean :-P

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
